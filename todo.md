### TODO

* Add plugins system (for example: fight handling can be embedded into a plugin & plugged if needed)
* Use OCR to detect dd number in enclos/inventory
* Add an XP system for dd
* Display global dd stats in log text view or in a widget
* Manage cowshed also, instead of enclos & inventory only
* Add option to switch/change player
* Use AI for rearing stuff
* Zaap positions are not always the same, so use OCR to detect them maybe? instead of change them for each player, or find a solution for zaap/zaapi use on multi-accounts
* Add treasure hunts management
* Allow user to add more Enclos locations (do the same for Zaap & Zaapi)
* Find a way/create an instruction to reverse path
* Auto-detect & close annoying windows (level up, invite, etc..), use ESC to close (already done for level up but need to apply it on the rest)
* Implement a more easy way to load/switch between maps on Map tab
* Finish collect action (#TODO)
* If podbar level didn't change after collect, we can consider that the resource was not collected
* Add an update feature? (from github repo, or simply create a deb package who doesn't erase/update data files)
* Add more bot state widgets (life widget for example)?
* Add french translation
